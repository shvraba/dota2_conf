These are the Launch Options and autoexec settings that I use when playing [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/][Dota 2]].  Understand that I play the game on [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]] and thus the config is tailored for that operating system.  That said, it should still work on any platform.

* Installing
** Launch Options

Simply copy-paste the contents of [[file:launch_options.txt][launch_options.txt]] into the Launch Options for Dota 2 in Steam.  You can find this under /Properties -> General -> Launch Options/.

** autoexec

Copy the file [[file:autoexec.cfg][autoexec.cfg]] to this location: =~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/cfg/=

_NOTE:_ This path may be different for you if you're using Windows.  Just Google it.
